Description
File Wrangler teaches the basics of files and directories in the Linux command line. You will use basic navigation commands to view files and directories and to move around between directories. You will also use commands to create new files and directories and commands for renaming, copying, moving and deleting them. Finally, you will use commands to view and change file permissions.

Background

This exercise will also introduce you to key commands for managing file and directory-level access control in Linux. The man pages for given commands can help when you are unsure of how to solve a challenge.
