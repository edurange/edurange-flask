### Your Briefing

Congratulations and welcome to CyberSec. As an intern you will need to complete this training on how to use the command line. You may need to strengthen your command line skills before you can complete the other parts of your training. Remember, this world is being controlled by the malicious corporations and individuals and we must learn to protect ourselves from their invasive attacks. We must protect our data. This is why you are here. To protect yourself, your company and your community. And it all starts here, at the beginning, with a terminal command prompt.
