## Using the Terminal Commands
When using your computer (Mac, Linux, Windows) you typically are using a GUI (Graphical User Interface). It's a pretty representation of how your computer works. To really get into the â€˜guts' of your computer and to really learn how to control it we will learn how to use the terminal. The terminal is a text based representation of your computer (rather than graphical). Learning to use the terminal will help you along your path to protecting your community and your self.

Why should you learn the command line?

- You gain greater control over the system (computer) because you have more options

- You can script repetitive tasks. A GUI interface just doesn't have the option to loop.

- Doing anything from a simple task of renaming a file, changing user information and searching for files is faster and easier through command line once you are comfortable with it.

- Scalability

- Scriptability

- Simple design

- Simple interface

- Stable design: sometimes it is the only interface you have

In summation, it allows you to do stuff faster than GUI and provides built in automation support.
