What is a command? Commands are executable programs that you can call from your command-line terminal. The most common place to look for bash commands is in the `/bin` folder. Let's get started right away and use two different commands.

### cd

`cd` stands for "change directory", meaning to navigate to a new folder.
Type each of the following. One at a time. Hitting enter after each

- `cd /`
- `cd /root`
- `cd`
- `cd ../`

The first command sends you to the root of your entire file system.

The second command sends you to the user root folder, but notice that you don't have permissions to that directory.

The third command sends you to your home directory

The fourth sends you backwards (up) a level.

TASK: `cd` to `/bin` then `cd` back to your home directory.

### ls

`ls` "lists" the files and directories of where you are now.

Type

- `ls`
