## Commands 
What is a command? Commands are executable programs that you can call from your command-line terminal. The most common place to look for bash commands is in the `/bin` folder. Let's get started right away and use two different commands.

### cd

`cd` stands for "change directory", meaning to navigate to a new folder. `cd ..` sends you backwards (up) a level.

TASK: `cd` to `/bin` then `cd` back to your home directory.

### ls

`ls` "lists" the files and directories of where you are now.

Type

- `ls`
