### pwd

`pwd` stands for "Print working directory" - it will tell you where you are within the filesystem.
Now type in

- `pwd`
 You should see something similar to `/home/yourusername`. To learn more type `man pwd`.


TASK: `cd` into your home directory and then type `ls` and you will see a directory called `follow_Me`. Travel as deep as that folder will go. When you get to the end there is a file whose name is a randomized number. Find that.

### sudo

Sometimes commands can only be run as a super user. This is when the command sudo comes to use (which stands for: superuser do). This gives unprivileged users access to privileged commands. The use of sudo in EDURange is restricted, however.
