## File Types
Not all files appear as they really are. Just because you see a file that says, `imanimage.png` does not mean that it is an image. It could be a text file or a harmful file if executed! So... how do you protect yourself? One way is with the file command!

### file

To find out what a file really is regardless of its extension is file. Check out the man page. Give it a peruse by typing in man file. What type of options are there with file? Now let's test it. Remember to type `q` to get out of the man page.

There are 2 files in your Linux box in a folder at your home directory called `/toLearn` . One is called `cat.jpg` and the other is `dog.jpg`

Both look like images to me! But if you try `file` and some other commands from the previous sections, you may notice some differences between the two.

### cat

Now let's learn a new command, cat. cat prints out the text from a file.

Type

- `cat dog.jpg`
Go throu
You should see something like:

`meow I am a doggo`

TASK: In your home directory there is a folder called `stuff`. Open that up and find out what file types are in there. One is a text file (ASCII). `cat` that and find the secret code inside.
